Star Topology
	As it emplies it looks like a star like layout.
	All of the computers are connected to the main central hub to get the internet access.
	It is a single point of access the main central hub was to be removed, then all of the devices will have no access to the internet.
	The central hub manages the flow of data traffice whithin the network by receiving data packets from one device and transmitting them tot he intended destination device.

	+ cheap and easy to manage for a home network.
	+ small to medium-sized networks

	- single point of failure when the main hub is offline.

Self questions to understand more about the type of network:

Q. What cable is used for devices in the star topology?
A. Ethernet Cable

Q. Which device commonly manages "the flow of data" in a star topology?
A. Switch (The key part here is that even though it is all in one hub) the Switch is the part the manages the flow of traffice within the topology.

Q. How does a star topology handle network congestion?
A. It can isolate congestion to specific devices while leaving the other devices remain unaffected. (providing you have enough bandwidth and the task you are doing)

Q. In a star topology, if one device fails, what happens to the rest of the network?
A. The network continues to function, unaffected by the failure of a single device.

Q. What is the main advantage of a star topology?
A. Easy to add or remove devices without affecting other devices.
A. Lower cost compared to other topologies.

Q. Can a star topology support wireless connections?
A. Yes, wireless connections can be used in addition to wired connections.

Q. Which of the following best describes a star topology?
A. All devices are connected to a central hub.

Q. Which network topology is commonly used in home and small office environments?
A. Star topology.

Q. What is the central device in a star topology called?
A. Hub
