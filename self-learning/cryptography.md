# Cryptography

Cryptography is the art of securing digital information by transforming it into an unreadable form, known as ciphertext.

The goal of cryptography is to ensure the CIA, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted or stored in computer systems.&#x20;



Encryption: the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a secret key.

Decryption: converting cipher text to plaintext.

Symmetric: (same): Shared-Key. AES, DES, 3DES.

Asymmetric: public-key. Uses a pair of related keys. A public and private key. The public-key is shared. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA).



Cryptanalysis is the study of cryptographic systems with the aim of finding weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can be exploited to break or bypass their security.

Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ensures that the compromise of long-term encryption keys does not compromise the confidentiality of past communications.
