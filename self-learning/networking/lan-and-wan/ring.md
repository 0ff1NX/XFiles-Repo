# Ring

Ring topology is a network configuration where network nodes are connected in a closed loop, forming a ring-like structure.

Key characteristics:

1. Circular pathway: In a ring topology, each node is connected to its immediate neighboring nodes. The last node is connected back to the first node, forming a closed loop.
2. Unidirectional data flow
3. Token-based or token-less approach: data transmission is often governed by a specific mechanism to control access to the network.
4. Data propagation delay: data must pass through each node within the ring before it can reach to its target destination.
5. Limited scalability: they can be challenging to setup as the number of nodes increases. Adding or removing nodes in a ring topology requires reconfiguration of the entire ring, which can disrupt network operations.
6. Fault tolerance: can have dual-ring configurations and can reroute data through alternative paths.
7. Balanced network performance: fairness shared bandwidth and usage.

Ring topologies still find application in certain environments, such as industrial control systems or optical networks, where their fault tolerance capabilites are beneficial.&#x20;
