# Mesh

The connections scale quadratically as the number of devices increase.

Mesh topologies offers a high scalability, reliability and easy expansion.

It offers high fault tolerance and redundancy. n^2

The mesh topology is a type of network where each device is inter-connected into each other.

There are two different types of mesh networks:

* Full Mesh
* Partial Mesh

The full mesh network, every device is directly connected to every other device, resulting in a high number of connections.

This offers the highest level of redundancy and fault tolerance but can be costly and complex to implement, especially in large networks.



In partial mesh, the devices have a subset of direct connections, allowing for a balance between redundancy and cost.

Mesh networks are commonly used in situation where reliability and resilience are crucial in an enterprise networks.



Some key advantages of mesh network topology include:

* redundancy and fault tolerance
* Scalability
* Flexibility
* Self-healing capability
* Enhanced coverage

Drawbacks:

* Complexity
* Cost
* Overheads
