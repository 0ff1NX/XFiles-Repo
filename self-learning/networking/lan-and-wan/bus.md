# Bus

The bus topology,  where the network nodes are connected to a single communication medium known as a bus. Data is transmitted in a bidirectional manner.

The key characteristics of a bus topology:

1\. Share communication, typically a coaxial cable or twisted pair cable

2. Single communication channel: all nodes are connected to the same bus.
3. Passive architecture: does not have any intelligence to manage the network.
4. Terminators: to prevent single reflections and ensure proper data transmission. They are used to absorb or terminate the signals to cause interference.
5. Easy implementation and scalability: less cabling compared to other topologies. Used in small to medium networks.
6. Single point of failure: Since all nodes depend on the bus for communication, a failure in the bus can disrupt the entire network.&#x20;
7. Limited performance: as more nodes are added to the bus, the avaliable bandwidth is shared among all connected nodes.
