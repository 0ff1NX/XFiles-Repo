# Tree

In a tree network the devices are connected resembling a tree.

It is a combination of bus and star topologies.

the flow of data flows from a unidirectional from the root node to the leaf nodes.

The ends are leaf nodes. The lowest level.

The tree topology provides many advantages:

* Scalability: nodes can be added or removed without affecting the whole network.
* Performance: minimises the number of devices that need to be traversed for data transmission.  It helps reduce network congestion and improving overall performance.
* Ceneralised control: from over the network, making it easier to manage and monitor network activites.
* Fault tolerance: allows for redundancy and fault tolerance. If a node or connection fails, alternative paths can be utilised to maintain network connectivity.
* Security: The tree topology offers enhanced security as access control and data flow can be enforced at different levels of the hierarchy.

Drawbacks:

* high dependency on the root node, if this fails the whole network is also inaccessible.
* Cost of implementing a tree networks can be higher compared other topologies.
* Complex design and maintenance: setting up and maintaining the structure requires careful planning and configuration.&#x20;
