# Line

Line Topology or also known as linear topology, this is a network configuration where all network nodes are connected in a linear sequence. Data flows in a unidirectional manner.

aka daisy-chain like structure, forming  a single continuous line.

key characteristics of the line topology:

1. Single communication path between any two nodes.
2. Two endpoints either end send the data back to the previous node until it hits the end.
3. Shared medium: all nodes in the topology share a common communication medium. Cable or virtual channel.
4. Limited scalability: best suited for networks, as the nodes increase, the length of the line and the time required for the data transmission between distant nodes also increase, eventually leading to performance issues.
5. Dependency on the first and last nodes.
6. Easy to implement: minimal cabling.
