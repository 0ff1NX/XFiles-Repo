# Routers

Packet Forwarding: Routers receive incoming data packets and examine in their destination IP (Internet protocol) addresses. Using routing table they determine the most efficient path to forward the packrats to each the intended destination.

Interconnection of Networks: subnets, LANs, WANs. Allows devices in one network to communicate with devices in other networks.

Network Address Translation (NAT): allows devices within a private network to share a single public IP address that connects the device to the outside world.

Firewall: Many routers have security policies applied to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules, protecting the network from unauthorised access and potential threats.

Dynamic Routing: routers can participate in dynamic routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), to exchange routing information with other routers.

Quality of Service (QoS): Routers can prioritise specific types of network traffic, network resources or time-sensitive data.

Virtual Private Network (VPN): Allowing secure remote access to private networks over the internet.
